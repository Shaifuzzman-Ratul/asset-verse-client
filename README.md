## Project Overview
AssetVerse is a modern, corporate Asset Management web platform that helps companies efficiently track, assign, and manage their physical assets such as laptops, keyboards, chairs, and other equipment. The system enables HR managers to control company assets, approve employee requests, and monitor asset usage in real time, while employees can request, view, and return assigned assets across multiple companies.
